# Bark
Bark! Voice what's going on around you on our location based social platform. Our login authentication is ran on the npm <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport">Passport.</a> To start as the user types in the required fields to sign up or login we check to make sure the inputs are all filled out and valid. We take these values and pass them into the passport into our <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/docs/authenticate/">passport authenticate</a> method. Here we check if the email has been taken already, if not we store the members information as cookies. We pass our password into the NPM package<a href="http://www.passportjs.org/docs/authenticate/">Bcrypt</a>  which will hash the members password and allow us to call on method to add extra characters to the end making in extremely hard to hack. 

<br>
Our members will access there the Bark! database and be able to see each individual relationship. We have created it so we render information based on the members location, and it will grab all post in that location. Results can also be filtered by category or user profile. 

<br>

Members have the option to create new content as well as add images for relevant information in their location and upvote notable posts.
